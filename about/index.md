Hello!

My name is **Shruti Kamath** and I am a Software Engineer at Amazon, Personalization.

I have been enjoying programming ever since high school, which encouraged me to take up
Computer Science. I did my B.E. from [R.V College of Engineering](http://www.rvce.edu.in/), Bangalore, India. Later, I did my M.S in Computer Science, Machine Learning from [Columbia University in the City of New York](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/)!

I am particularly interested in building scalable machine learning systems.

I have been learning so much from online tech community and in this blog I hope to share content through some of the projects that I do for fun and learnings from being in the tech community!

Also, I enjoy exploring the outdoor, particularly through hiking. Washington is so beautiful surrounded by the Pacific Cascades mountains. Here, you will also find some of my experiences and tips on hikes I have been on in Washington.
